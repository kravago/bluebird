As a novice skiier, I would like an easy way to identify great days to go skiing. I built this application to help pick out sunny days to go skiing, and specifically bluebird days. Currently you can see the forecast to most ski resorts in the United States and save them to a list of favorites. Bluebird will point out sunny days or bluebird days, helping you see the best days to go to the resorts you like.
